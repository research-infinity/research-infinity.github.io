                        The Greeks viewed infinity negatively. The word ranged from many different meanings: <i>unbound, indefinite, complex, total disorder, or undefined</i>.
                        The chaos before the world was created was considered infinite, a crooked line too. Aristotle, a Greek philosopher, noticed that many aspects of the world seemed infinite.
                        Time could go on forever and space could be infinitly divisable, making it possible for a line to contain an infinite number of points.
                        In order to avoid chaos and confusion that could threaten the orderliness of a finite universe, Aristotle coined the term <i>potentially infinite</i>;
                        this way he did not have to consider <i>actually infinte</i> concepts and numbers.
                        For example, he said that the set of all natural numbers is potentially infinite.
                        Because there is no <i>largest</i> natural number and no finished list, the set of all natural numbers cannot be actually infinite.
                        Plato and Pythagoras did not belive in any infinities, not even potential infinities. Although many philosiphers at the time had their doubts about infinity, paradoxes like Achilles and the tortoise and the Arrow paradox, created by Zeno, were still used to try to understand the infamous concept.
                        The first philosopher to belive in the sightest concept of infinity was Plotinus; he belived that God, or the One, was infinite.

						The first use of the infinity symbol, the lemniscate, came along in the 1700s on the Magus (a.k.a. Juggler)
						Tarot card. In the Medieval Era, along with the Renaissance, the concept of infinity gained traction in the
						mathematical community. St. Augustine altered Plotinus’s philosophy to fit the Christian religion. Through the
						exploration of infinity, many paradoxes like the Angles on a Pin paradox and the idea the two infinities can be
						equal and different at the same time, arose. Galileo Galilei was not only an astronomer, as we know him to be,
						but one of the great influences when it came to infinity. He was able
						“solve” paradoxes, or at least explain the possible solutions, and he made his own paradoxes as well. As you can
						see paradoxes are
						important to understanding infinity.
						<br>
						<br>
						In the 1600s, now that Calculus had been invented, the concept of infinity was now able to expand. Motion, as we
						know from Zeno’s paradoxes, has to do with infinity. In the formula x = f(t), where x is your distance value and
						f(t) is the function of time, t has an infinite number of values. Pretend that you have traveled for 1 second.
						This 1 second can be divided into 1000 milliseconds or 1000000 microseconds or 1000000000 nanoseconds…. This is
						where we get into the idea of infinitesimals. If you want to measure the velocity a an instant t_i you could be
						having to find the speed over an infinitely small time interval dt. The formula for that would be
						<br>(f(t_i + dt) - f(t_i)) / dt.
						In this case dt would be the infinitesimal, meaning that it is an infinitely small quantity that has a value
						approaching zero.  Infinitesimals can be considered zero when in cases of an addition between an infinitesimal
						and a regular number. But it is not zero because it can be used as a denominator in a fraction. Adding a finite
						amount of infinitesimals would give you another infinitesimal, but adding an infinite number of infinitesimals
						can result in a regular number or an infinitely large number. Well stop there not to get too deep into calculus.

						During the late-19th century, Georg Cantor developed the first theory of actual infinity. Cantor is considered the founder of the modern mathematical theory of infinity. He was the first to decide infinity in terms of א (aleph). I’ll talk about alephs more in the next section. Cantor was first working with Koch curves at the beginning of his career in studying infinity. The Koch curve is a limit of an infinite sequence of divisions. To create a Koch curve you begin with a straight line. Divide it into three equal segments and replace the middle segment by the two sides of an equilateral triangle of the same length as the segment being removed. Now repeat, taking each of the four resulting segments, dividing them into three equal parts and replacing each of the middle segments by two sides of an equilateral triangle. <img src="Koch.gif" alt="" style="width: 200px; padding: 20px 20px"/> <br>From this Cantor went on to discuss points on a line and that a point on a line has a greater infiniteness than that of all the natural numbers.
